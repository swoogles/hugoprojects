### Take-aways!

---
Don't pass collections into lambdas that will be applied to that same collection.

(Don't nest loops.)

---
Accept defeat when you encounter a fatal Exception.

(Don't swallow Exceptions)

---
If you don't have a test that can trigger the original problem, you don't truly know what's wrong.
